    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Traditional Roman pasta, belonging to the "Poker of Roman Pastas".
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients (for 4 people)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>400g of spaghetti</li>
        <li>200g of Pecorino Romano DOP, finely grated</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h4>Prepare the Black Pepper:</h4>
            <p>
                Toast a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper in a large, non-stick pan over medium heat for about 1-2 minutes. This step helps release the pepperâ€™s aromatic oils.
                 Once fragrant, remove the pan from the heat.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Cook the Spaghetti:</h4>
            <p>
                Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the spaghetti until <strong>al dente</strong>, following the package instructions. Be sure to reserve at least 1.5 cups of pasta cooking water before draining the pasta.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Create the Cacio e Pepe Sauce:</h4>
            <p>
                While the pasta is cooking, finely grate the Pecorino Romano into a large bowl. Gradually add some of the reserved hot pasta cooking water to the Pecorino, stirring constantly to form a smooth,
                 creamy paste. The water should be just hot enough to melt the cheese but not so hot that it causes it to clump.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Combine the Spaghetti and Sauce:</h4>
            <p>
                Once the spaghetti is drained, transfer it to the pan with the toasted black pepper. Toss the pasta over low heat to coat it with the pepper. Gradually add the Pecorino cream to the spaghetti, tossing vigorously to ensure that the sauce evenly coats each strand.
                 If the sauce seems too thick, add a bit more of the reserved pasta water to achieve the desired creamy consistency.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Final Touch:</h4>
            <p>
                Serve immediately, with additional freshly ground black pepper on top, if desired. For an extra kick, you can sprinkle more Pecorino Romano on each plate.
            </p>
        </li>

            <h4>Enjoy!</h4>
