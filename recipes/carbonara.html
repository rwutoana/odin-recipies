        <li>400g of "mezze maniche" pasta</li>
        <li>150g of guanciale (cured pork cheek)</li>
        <li>4 egg yolks</li>
        <li>100g of Pecorino Romano DOP, finely grated</li>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h4>Prepare the Guanciale:</h4>
            <p>Cut the guanciale into strips or cubes about 1 cm wide. In a non-stick pan, without adding any oil, cook the guanciale over
                medium-low heat. Let it render its fat and become crispy. Once done, turn off the heat and leave the guanciale in the pan to rest.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Prepare the Egg and Pecorino Cream:</h4>
            <p>
                In a bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the grated Pecorino Romano until you have a smooth, creamy mixture. Season with a generous amount of freshly 
                ground black pepper.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Cook the Pasta:</h4>
            <p>
                Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the mezze maniche until they are <strong>al dente</strong>, following the instructions on the package. 
                Before draining the pasta, reserve about a cup of the cooking water.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Combine and Serve:</h4>
            <p>
                Once the pasta is drained, quickly transfer it to the pan with the guanciale, mixing it well to coat it with the rendered fat. Remove the 
                pan from the heat and gradually add the egg and Pecorino mixture, stirring constantly to create a creamy sauce. If the sauce seems too thick, you can add a small amount 
                of the reserved pasta cooking water to achieve the desired consistency.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Final Touch:</h4>
            <p>
                Serve immediately, sprinkling additional freshly ground black pepper & Pecorino Romano on top, if desired.
            </p>
        </li>

            <h4>Enjoy!</h4>
