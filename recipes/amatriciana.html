    <ul>
        <li>400g of "mezze maniche" pasta</li>
        <li>150g of guanciale (cured pork cheek)</li>
        <li>400g of peeled tomatoes (preferably San Marzano)</li>
        <li>80g of Pecorino Romano DOP, finely grated</li>
        <li>1 small red chili pepper (optional)</li>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil (just a drizzle)</li>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

            <h4>Prepare the Guanciale:</h4>
            <p>
                Cut the guanciale into strips about 1 cm wide. In a large non-stick pan, heat a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil over medium heat (optional, as guanciale releases its own fat). Add the guanciale and cook until it becomes crispy and golden, releasing its fat. If you like a bit of spice, add a chopped small red chili pepper at this stage. Once the guanciale is ready,
                 remove it from the pan and set it aside, leaving the rendered fat in the pan.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Prepare the Sauce:</h4>
            <p>
                In the same pan with the guanciale fat, add the peeled tomatoes, breaking them up with a wooden spoon. Let the sauce simmer over medium-low heat for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Season with a little salt (not too much, as the guanciale and Pecorino are salty) and freshly ground black pepper. If the sauce reduces too much, you can add a bit of water.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Cook the Pasta:</h4>
            <p>
                Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the mezze maniche until they are <strong>al dente</strong>, following the instructions on the package. 
                Before draining the pasta, reserve about a cup of the cooking water.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Combine the Pasta and Sauce:</h4>
            <p>
                Once the pasta is drained, add it to the pan with the tomato sauce. Mix well to ensure the pasta is fully coated with the sauce. If needed, add a little of the reserved pasta cooking water to achieve a perfect, glossy consistency.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Final Touch:</h4>
            <p>
                Stir in the crispy guanciale. Serve immediately, generously sprinkling each plate with finely grated Pecorino Romano and freshly ground black pepper.
            </p>
