    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Traditional Roman pasta, belonging to the "Poker of Roman Pastas".
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients (for 4 people)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>400g of "mezze maniche" pasta</li>
        <li>150g of guanciale (cured pork cheek)</li>
        <li>100g of Pecorino Romano DOP, finely grated</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h4>Prepare the Guanciale:</h4>
            <p>
                Cut the guanciale into strips about 1 cm wide. In a large non-stick pan, heat a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil over medium heat (optional, as guanciale releases its own fat). Add the guanciale and cook until it becomes crispy and golden, releasing its fat. If you like a bit of spice, add a chopped small red chili pepper at this stage. Once the guanciale is ready,
                 remove it from the pan and set it aside, leaving the rendered fat in the pan.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Cook the Pasta:</h4>
            <p>
                While the guanciale is cooking, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
                 Cook the mezze maniche until <strong>al dente</strong>, following the package instructions. Before draining the pasta, reserve a cup of the pasta cooking water.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Combine the Pasta and Guanciale:</h4>
            <p>
                Once the pasta is drained, quickly transfer it to the pan with the guanciale and its rendered fat. Mix well to coat the pasta evenly.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Add Pecorino and Pepper</h4>
            <p>
                Off the heat, gradually add the finely grated Pecorino Romano to the pasta, tossing it well to ensure it melts evenly and creates a creamy sauce. Add a few tablespoons of the reserved pasta cooking water if needed to achieve the perfect consistency.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Final Touch:</h4>
            <p>
                Finish with a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper. Serve immediately, adding more Pecorino Romano on top if desired.
            </p>
